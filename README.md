### Static vs dynamic lighting

This game supports dynamic lighting by using a light probe. To enable dynamic lighting you can access the game settings from the main menu. You will also need something to act as a light probe: a ping pong ball will do the job perfectly!

### Crafting the base

You can easily craft your own probe stand and place it in the center of the board. The cylinder height should be 5cm.
Here's an example:

You can download the package linked below that contains the files to 3d print your base. Note that the base must be 5cm high on a A3 marker. The game contains a secret debug GUI accessible from the bottom left corner of the game screen that allows you to adjust the light probe position to match your base in case you need it.
Enjoy dynamic lighting in AR!
